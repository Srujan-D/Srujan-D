### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some cool robotics projects. You can check them out [here](https://srujan-d.github.io/projects/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning concepts of motion and path planning for mobile robotics, although I often dive into SLAM.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on compiling some good resources for local path planning for dynamic obstacle avoidance, mainly for UAVs. If you have any other idea, feel free to hit me up!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how I as an UG student can dive into conducting research.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srujan-deolasee/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sruj_d?s=09).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / him
- âš¡ Fun fact: You can get one such summary too -- just create a GitHub repo with the name exactly matching your username, and anything you write in the repo's README will show up here.
