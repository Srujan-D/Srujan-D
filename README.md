### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Junior at BITS Pilani, Pilani campus. Most of the times, you will find me swimming in the vast ocean that robotics is.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a research intern at the [A.R.M.S. Lab at IIT Bombay](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/), and also at [CSIR-CEERI Pilani](https://www.ceeri.res.in/). I also work on an Autonomous Quadcopter Project as a part of [Team Robocon](https://bitsrobocon.github.io/) (The Robotics Club at BITS Pilani).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning concepts of motion and path planning for mobile robotics, although I often dive into SLAM.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on compiling some good resources for local path planning for dynamic obstacle avoidance, mainly for UAVs. If you have any other idea, feel free to hit me up!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how I as an UG student can dive into conducting research.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srujan-deolasee/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sruj_d?s=09).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / him
- âš¡ Fun fact: You can get one such summary too -- just create a GitHub repo with the name exactly matching your username, and anything you write in the repo's README will show up here.
