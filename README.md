### Hi there 👋

I am a Computer Science Junior at BITS Pilani, Pilani campus. Most of the times, you will find me swimming in the vast ocean that robotics is.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a research intern at [CSIR-CEERI Pilani](https://www.ceeri.res.in/). I also work on an Autonomous Quadcopter Project as a part of [Team Robocon](https://bitsrobocon.github.io/) (The Robotics Club at BITS Pilani).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DL and RL, with the aim of exploring hybrid class (classical based + learning based) robot path planning algorithms.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research in path planning. If you have any other idea, feel free to hit me up!
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srujan-deolasee/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sruj_d?s=09).
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: You can get one such summary too -- just create a GitHub repo with the name exactly matching your username, and anything you write in the repo's README will show up here.
